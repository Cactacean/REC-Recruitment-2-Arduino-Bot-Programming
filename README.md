# REC-Recruitment-2-Arduino-Bot-Programming

the code is uploaded to github instead of directly done of it cuz i went straight into code thinking that 'ah, our team finished ME and EE design quite late, maybe we can skip on this step'

huge mistake.
huge mistake on my part.

even though the code depends on hardware, version control is still important since every parameters in hardware changes can bring you back to a stage like you've done nothing.

and github is the best tool for version control.



also, the different functions i.e. movement and cube dropping

shall be seperated into different files 
for better readability and working with teammates in parallel
